# Assignment 03 - Report

<p>Firstly, we initialized a virtual environment in chapter03 of practical programming for iot repo that we cloned in early lessons. Then, after installing packages mentioned in requirements.txt file, we prepared our circuit similar to the button_pigpio.py assignment. Then we tried to run the flask_api_server.py and flask_ws_server.py files one by one. You can see the snapshots of our result in figure-1 and figure-2.</p>
